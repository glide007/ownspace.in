After much of deliberation on what to write as my first post my new/recreated blog, so I am going to back to hello world in couple of language which I use daily.


.. code-block:: Java

    public class Hello{
        public static void main(String [] args){
    	    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
    }

.. code-block:: C

    #include<stdio.h>
    main()
    {
    	printf("Hello World");
    }

I am alo not going to promise which kind of article I am going to write, at the same time I am promising my self, that I will try to be honest with me and try to write as much as I can with limitd time I get out of my work and family.
